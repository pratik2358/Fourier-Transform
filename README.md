# Fourier-Transform
A lucid visual walk through Fourier Transform

Fourier transform has been a really important methodology to analyse signals that may be audio, image, video or any time series data. The mathematics behind this is really fascinating and one should look into it visually to understand the concepts behind it.
This is an effort towards that visualisation and basic understanding.
One can simply read the pdf that I have uploaded here or if they want to try things hands on, they may freely download and play with the IPYNB file.
